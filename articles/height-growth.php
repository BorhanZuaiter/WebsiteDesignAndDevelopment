						<h3>Do bodybuilding exercise stop your height growth ?</h3>

						<p>We all wanted to carry weights in our youth and register in a sports club, but the following statement is that resistance exercises will stop our growth! Especially from our mothers because of reading articles on the magazines of the graceful woman or through a friend regarding Alu Al Hadid is wrong.</p>
						<br>

						<p>From where did this saying that bodybuilding stop growth?
						<br>Simply the joints are the ones with the length, and people think that by pressing the joints through the weights, this will hurt them and work to stop the growth..
						<br>Science and research tell us about bodybuilding and growth ‚Åâ
						<br>There is no negative effect on resistance exercises (bodybuilding) on height. Simply
						<br>And a lot of research tells us that weight lifting helps in growth, due to the rise in growth hormone and testosterone in the body after resistance exercises.
						<br>The only link between stopping growth and resistance exercises is with injury due to the wrong technique!
						<br>This is common among young people because they want to lift heavy weights with a wrong technique to surprise their friends..
						<br>This is why playing resistance exercises for young people is a good thing, but care must be taken with technique and the correct weights.</p>
